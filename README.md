## About EventScape

EventScape is a modern, customisable app designed to simplify event planning and invitations. Its offers a private, visually engaging platform where users can host, discover and personalise events with creative themes inspired by Bebo's customisation features. We've integrated the Google Calendar in order to further streamline event scheduling, making it an intuitive alternative to traditional platforms like Facebook Events.

EventScape's focus on privacy, creativity and community engagement makes it ideal for individuals and groups seeking a unique and user-friendly way to organise events, from casual gatherings to larger-scale activites.

## Data Flow Diagram


![DFD](/src/docs/DFD4.png)


This Data Flow Diagram (DFD) follows the Yourdon and Coad notation in order to provide a clear and structured visualisation of how the data will be processed, stores and communicated within this application. By following this notation style, the diagram ensures consistency, clarity and an easily interpretable view of system interaction at a high level. The diagram uses the following conventions:

* Circles (Processes): Represent the key operations or processes in the system, which transform incoming data into outputs.
* Arrows (Data Flows): Indicate the direction of data movement between processes, data stores and external entites, showcasing how information is passed througout the system. Each arrow is colour-coded, to avoid confusion: a diagram colour key has been included for the same purpose. For further clarity, each arrow has been numbered regarding where each data process begins and ends.
* Squares (External Entities): Depict the external actors or systems that interact with the system, either providing input or receiving input.
* Open Rectangles (Data Stores): Illustrate where data is stored within the system, such as databases or file storage.

## User Stories

The image below is the user stories for EventScape, 4 user stories in the "As a {person}, I want to do {feature/action} because of {need/reason}" format.

![UserStories](/src/docs/User%20Stories.png)

As an elabration of the user stories above, please see below  the first iteration of the user personas and their different perscpectives of what problem the app will solve.

![UserPersonas](/src/docs/User%20persona%20version%201.png)

The second iteration(below), is a refined version of the user stories with more of a focus on the MVP of the app.

## Wireframes

For the wireframes I've kept the styling simple, using Poppins as the main font, used because its a clear easy to read font. I've gone with a simple colour scheme, to not be too disctracting for users, especially since a large feature of the app is the colour customisation.

Here is the Sitemap showing the interaction between pages:

### Wide-Screen Wireframes

Below you can see the wide-screen wireframes, the first screenshot shows the 'Create new Account 'page, which upon clicking 'Sign-up' leads to the 'See My Events' page, which leads to the My Events/My Calendar. The 'Create New' button leads to the Event Creation page, where the user creates the event invitation. In the second screenshot there are examples of what a user might 'publish' as their styled Event Invite. There is also a 'See you there!' page when a user clicks 'Attending' on an event.

### Mobile Wireframes

I've kept the Mobile wireframes simple, similar to the Wide-screen wireframes, just with vertical stacking instead of the larger grid used for the wide-screen wireframes.

Our team has utilised the Agile planning methodology with Trello to efficiently manage our application development process. We've structured our workflow with "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed" card lists to maintain clear organisation. Each task card includes due dates, relevant links, detailed checklists, and member assignments, ensuring accountability and streamlined collaboration.

### Unit & Integration Testing

We implemented integration tests for all user routes to ensure reliability and robustness in handling cor functionalities like fetching profiles, updating details and deleting accounts. Using Jest, we mocked dependencies such as UserModel and validateUserAuth middleware to isolate application logic and simulate real-world interactions with supertest.

Our tests covered both success and failure scenarios, validating proper handling of edge cases, such as non-existent users, duplicate usernames and invalid input. I focused on clear error responses, correct status codes and meaningful feedback for users.

This approach ensured thorough coverage, improved security, and maintained test clarity, providing confidence in the application's behaviour under real-world conditions.

![userRoute_int2](/src/docs/userRoutes_patch.png)

![userRoute_int3](/src/docs/userRoute_del.png)

Furthermore, we designed integration tests to validate the behaviour of the API endpoints and middleware, focusing on root routes, CORs headers and controller endpoints. These tests ensure the application responds as expected under various conditions.

   * Root API Tests: Verified endpoint returns the correct message and status code, and confirmed no Authorization header is present in the response when not providied.

   * CORS Validation: Ensured the application handles both valid and invalid Origin headers, allowing orrejecting requests based on CORS policies.

   * Controller Endpoints: Tested multiple endpoints (/account, /user, /event, etc.) to confirm appropriate 404 responses for unhandled routes, ensuring users receive clear feedback on unavailable resources.

![server_test](/src/docs/server_test.png)


Individual unit tests were also performed on both RSVP and Auth routes. Ideally, we would have perform integration tests on all routes in the application, but were unfortunately unable to do so due to time constraints.
